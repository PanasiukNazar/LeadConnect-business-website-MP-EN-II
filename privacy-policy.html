                        We may work with third-party advertisers to promote our
                        services. These advertisers may use cookies or similar
                        tracking technologies to serve ads tailored to your
                        preferences. You can manage ad preferences through your
                        browser settings or by visiting the opt-out pages of

                        We periodically request feedback and conduct surveys to
                        understand user satisfaction and improve our services.
                        Participation is voluntary, and feedback data is
                        anonymized and used solely for internal purposes.

                        Our platform may allow you to share content on social
                        media. When you share content, any personal information
                        shared on social media platforms is subject to the
                        privacy policies of those platforms. We encourage users

                        sharing.

                        notify affected users and relevant regulatory
                        authorities as required by law. We take these situations

                    <h2>21. Browser Do Not Track Signals</h2>

                    <p>
                        Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" feature. Our
                        platform does not currently respond to Do Not Track
                        signals. However, we provide users with the option to
                        manage cookies and tracking through their browser
                        settings.

                    <h2>22. Data Anonymization and Aggregation</h2>

                    <p>
                        For analysis and research purposes, we may anonymize or
                        aggregate data to better understand user behavior
                        without identifying individuals. Aggregated data is used
                        to enhance our services and may be shared with partners
                        for analytical purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>23. Changes in Ownership</h2>

                    <p>
                        In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of our
                        business, personal information may be transferred as
                        part of the business assets. We will notify users of
                        such changes and provide the option to manage their
                        personal data under the new ownership.
                    </p>

                    <h2>24. Cross-Border Data Processing</h2>

                        than your own. We comply with cross-border data
                        processing regulations and ensure that adequate data
                        protection safeguards are in place.
